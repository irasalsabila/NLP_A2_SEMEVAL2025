PT_233.txt	"""A maioria dos textos do artigo enfatiza os efeitos negativos das alterações climáticas, como inundações, incêndios florestais, baixas na temperatura e no nível dos rios.This is a really interesting piece of research. One thing that struck me was the difference between the two main figures in the paper, the first showing the evolution of the solar cycle, and the second showing the evolution of the cosmic ray flux. I was expecting the two to be more in sync, as they are both driven by the sun's activity. But they are clearly not. The solar cycle seems to be the dominant factor, and the cosmic ray flux seems to be a secondary effect. So why does this happen? I think it's because the cosmic ray flux is actually a proxy for the solar wind speed, which is a measure of the solar activity. The solar wind speed is driven by the solar cycle, but the cosmic ray flux is driven by the solar wind speed. So the cosmic ray flux is actually a measure of the solar wind speed, which is a measure of the solar activity. The solar cycle is the dominant factor, and the cosmic ray flux is a secondary effect."
